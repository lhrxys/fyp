# FYP Project 
Hello! This is my FYP project which aims to extract origami crease patterns from images into the [FOLD file format](https://github.com/edemaine/fold), making it easier to analyse them using existing computational origami software. The web application can be found here: [Raster to FOLD Converter](https://lynnhow.github.io/fyp/).
